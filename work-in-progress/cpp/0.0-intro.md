# Introduction to the Haxe `cpp` package features

This section covers some of the more frequently asked questions about features in the `cpp.*` package of the Haxe API. 

Since many of the features stashed in this package are literal parallels directly to c++ concepts, many of the features in the API require a good understanding of c++ first, and won't necessarily be covered in full detail here.

However, we will focus on covering concrete examples of the features that _don't_ require strong c++ knowledge but are more aimed at the Haxe user targetting the hxcpp backend.

Some examples include manipulating the garbage collector, using threads and synchronization features, and loading and executing code from dynamic libraries.
