# 5.1 Building a dynamic library from haxe/hxcpp code, via an extern C api

As the previous section expanded on the challenges, this section will give a concrete example on compiling and using haxe and hxcpp generated code in a dynamic library by means of `extern "C"` to expose a portable API.

It is important to note that the client code of our example is specifically going to use the simpler and easier to use/read `dlopen` and related functions. The functions to load symbols from a dynamic library vary by platform and are not the point of the example. For the same reason of simplicity and clarity the compiler used in the example is clang on macOS, so the example should work on linux/mac with minimal effort. Most languages allow loading and interacting with a dynamic library as a client though so your choice of client are many. 

The other important detail is that there are concepts that are not shown or covered for the sake of a clear example. Things like handling proper versioning, opaque types (handles) and all those constructs are not the focus of this example. This includes the concept of a header-based library, where the client code includes an API defined in a header file and the dynamic library itself. We are going to simplify a lot.

Our goal here is to in very plain form show the steps required in order to use hxcpp code in a dynamic library. Taking this knowledge and applying general good practices and platform specific nuances will be an exercise of the reader for now.

## Parts of a whole

There are three parts to our simple example.
 
- The client `client` (c++/any)
- The library wrapper `shared` (c++)
- The library code `lib` (haxe)

The shared library is our ultimate goal, the lib part is the haxe code we want to use in the shared library, and the client is the user of the library.

We will start with the simplest of these, the haxe code.
In a future guide, some of the details with regards to the three parts can be merged into the hxcpp build step, for now they are distinct, as it is frequently useful to treat the haxe generated code a static library.

## Part 1: The library code, `lib` i.e "Empty.hx"

Here is our implementation for the library written in haxe.

```haxe
import cpp.link.StaticRegexp;
import cpp.link.StaticStd;
import cpp.link.StaticZlib;

class Empty {
 
    static function main() {
        trace('hello empty library');
    }

    static function test() {
        trace('hello test function');
    }

}
```

Here we stick to the basics for simplicity: A single static main entry point of our library, and a single static test function. The top imports are used to bring all the hxcpp haxe standard code into the build, this prevents needing depedencies later.

#### Building the haxe code for use in a dynamic library

The guide on linking and targets mentions that we can build a dynamic, static, or executable for many targets. In this example, we build statically, so that we can link our static hxcpp code with a simple wrapper.

The guide covers some details, but this is the `build-lib.hxml` file to compile it.

```hxml
-main Empty
-cpp cpp/
-D static_link
```

This will generate a static library file inside of the `cpp/` folder. Since we're demonstrating on linux/mac our file is called `libEmpty.a`. Take note that this is a static library, and that we combine it with part 2 into a dynamic library. If you name them the same thing it can be easily confusing.

We build this using `haxe build-lib.hxml`.

That's all there is to the first part.

## Part 2: The library wrapper `shared`, i.e the dynamic library iself

In order to use our now generated hxcpp code in another project, there are some things that hxcpp needs to be initialized, and to call the `static main` for your code. 

**initializing the hxcpp stack**   
The first of these is the requirement to let hxcpp know about threads and stack information. This is not the focus of our example, so we just take note that hxcpp requires calling `hxcpp_set_top_of_stack();` somewhere before running the hxcpp part. Instead of having to include headers to talk about this c function, we will tell the code we are referring to an external symbol before we do:

`extern void hxcpp_set_top_of_stack();`

**initializing the hxcpp entry point**   
Now that hxcpp is ready to go, we want to call `hxRunLibrary`. This calls the haxe `static main` and does all the rest of the work hxcpp needs to do, including static initializers and so on. This function returns a c string, because if the haxe code throws an haxe exception, it will be returned to you here. As before, we tell the code we are referring to the external symbol first:

`extern const char* hxRunLibrary();`

#### The outward facing API

Now comes the part where we want to expose our function. We will call it `empty_test` and it will call our `static function test()` in the haxe code. Remember the `static main` is called by the `hxRunLibrary` part.

To expose the function without name mangling and all that, we just use: 

```c++
extern "C" {

    void empty_test() {
        //call haxe generated code here
    }

}
```

#### Calling the haxe generated code

Now, in order to call a function in our haxe code we must make note of the following.

- The haxe generated code is just c++ and c++ header files
- The files once generated can be referenced and used as regular c++
- The files exist in the `cpp/` output folder specified in the build hxml

This means we will want to look for the header where our `Empty` class is defined, and include it. We will also need to add the include path to tell the c++ compiler where to find it. These concepts are basic c++ and not covered in detail here.

Because we put our `Empty.hx` in the root folder, the accompanying `Empty.cpp` and `cpp/include/Empty.h` and `cpp/src/Empty.cpp` are in the root folder.

To include it, we add `cpp/include` to our include paths for the compiler, and we have the cpp code stored inside the static library. We just need the header to call it. Since the code is compiled as hxcpp generated code, we will need to add the include path to the hxcpp headers as well. This is typically in your hxcpp haxelib directory, i.e for hxcpp `3.2.205` it might be `haxelib/hxcpp/3,2,205/include`. You can often see this path when compiling regular hxcpp code, and can use `haxelib path hxcpp` to help locate it.

Now we add:

`#include "Empty.h"`

Adding this lets use talk about the haxe generated type directly.
Since the function we are calling is static in the haxe code, we can find it inside our `Empty.h` file as normal c++ `static void test();` surrounded by the bookkeeping hxcpp uses to function. 

**Take note** that the type inside the file is appended with `_obj`, so to talk about our Empty.hx class we use `Empty_obj`. To call a static function in c++ you would call `Empty_obj::test()`.


#### Initializing the library from the client

For this example, instead of dealing with the details of dynamic library entry points, we will use an explicit initialize call for our library, which we will call `run_haxe`. This function returns an int like a regular `main` function would in c++ for convenience. This function we'll call as the entry point to our library later.


```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "Empty.h"

extern "C" {
    
    extern void hxcpp_set_top_of_stack();
    extern const char* hxRunLibrary();

    int run_haxe() {
        
        hxcpp_set_top_of_stack();

        const char *err = hxRunLibrary();

        if(err) {
            printf("Error %s\n", err);
            return -1;
        }
        
        return 0;

    } //run_haxe

    void empty_test() {
        Empty_obj::test();
    }

} //extern c
```

#### Building the shared library

This part is specific to how you build your library, but in this example we will use clang on mac to compile and link our library. On mac, the dynamic library is a `dylib` file, so we expect to build a `libEmpty.dylib` from this command. I have excluded some of the commands in the snippet below. The full build file can be seen in the example repo.

`clang++ -lempty -L../1-lib/cpp/ -I../1-lib/cpp/include/ -I<HXCPP_PATH>/include -dynamiclib -o libEmpty.dylib empty.cpp`

I'll specify each part of the command for clarity.
- `-lempty` - link `libEmpty.a` (generated by Part 1)
- Where will it find `libEmpty.a`? `-L../1-lib/cpp`.
    - The `-L` tell it to look for libraries in this path
    - The example uses relative paths for each part.
- Where will it find our `.h` header files for `#include`?
    - The `-I` tells it to look for headers in this path 
    - The generated header files, `-I../1-lib/cpp/include/`
    - The hxcpp header files `-I<HXCPP_PATH>/include`
- `-dynamiclib` is specifically for clang to know you want a dynamic library
- What should the output name be? `-o libEmpty.dylib`
- Which files should it build + link - `empty.cpp`

Keep in mind you'll want to use the same compiler as the static library i.e the compiler + c runtime that hxcpp used, as it's a static library, they must match. For example, if I specified `-stdlib=libstdc++` via hxcpp to the static library, but tried to use `-stdlib=libc++` here, it would complain.

If all goes according to plan, you now have a dynamic library that can be used by other languages and clients for the built platform + architecture. You can use tools like `nm` to display the symbols inside the library and confirm that they are not mangled, and are easily accessible. There are many tools depending on the platform, Depencency Walker for Windows, `readelf` `nm` `objdump` and more on linux and mac.

On mac, I used `nm -gU libEmpty.dylib` (extern symbols only, -U says don't show undefined symbols, only the ones defined here).

This yields what we'd have hoped for:

```
0000000000065430 T _empty_test
00000000000653d0 T _run_haxe
```

Now a client can look up that symbol, and reference it.

## Part 3: The client `client`.

As specified, we will be doing an explicit and simple example to demonstrate.

To open a dynamic library using `dlopen`, we use:

`void* handle = dlopen("libEmpty.dylib", RTLD_NOW);`

This returns a handle, which we need to close it later:

`dlclose(handle);`

And finally, to grab a symbol out of the library, we use:

`void* init = dlsym(handle, "run_haxe")`
`void* test = dlsym(handle, "empty_test")`

Here's the full example code for mac, again the paths are set up according to the repository relative paths:

```c++
#include <dlfcn.h>

//Define a function pointer typedef for clearer code below
//A void function, no return and no arguments.
typedef void (*VoidFN)(void);

int main() {

    void* handle = dlopen("../2-shared/libEmpty.dylib", RTLD_NOW);

        //first we initialize the library + thus hxcpp
    void* init = dlsym(handle, "run_haxe");
        //since the return is a void*, we want to cast it to a function pointer
        //We defined a function pointer typedef above called VoidFN
    VoidFN init_fn = (VoidFN)init;
        //Now we can call it like a regular function (pointer)
    init_fn();

        //Same goes for the test function.
    void* test = dlsym(handle, "empty_test");
    VoidFN test_fn = (VoidFN)test;
    
    test_fn();

        //Now we close the library as we don't need it
    dlclose(handle);

    return 0;

} //main
```

#### Building the client

As with the shared library, we just use clang, the `-o` specifies the name of the executable binary we are building:

`clang++ -o client client.cpp`

Now we have an executable called `client` in the folder, that we can run.
If it can find the dynamic library like it should, when you run it with `./client` should see:

```
Empty.hx:8: hello empty library
Empty.hx:12: hello test function
```

This output comes from our haxe code and we can see that we're calling it from the dynamic library. If you rebuild the haxe library + shared wrapper (required to rebuild both if the haxe code changes, by definition!) then you can change the behavior of the program by simply changing the dynamic library.

## Conclusion

Hopefully the example shows enough to understand the key concepts required in exposing your hxcpp code via a dynamic library. In subsequent examples we might cover how to move the shared library + static library steps into one - using haxe + hxcpp build tool to generate the dynamic library directly.

This won't remove the need to wrap the library, but it does simplify the build process a lot. Once the fundamentals are understood, you can get as complicated as you'd like by leveraging haxe macros and other forms of automation to expose your types in this manner for you. The `buildXml` node and the `extern` capabilities of haxe and hxcpp give you plenty of power in order to create a workable solution depending on your needs.
