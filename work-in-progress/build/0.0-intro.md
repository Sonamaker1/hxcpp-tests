# Introduction to the hxcpp build pipeline

What exactly happens when you build Haxe for the hxcpp c++ target?

## The C++ build process

To begin, it's important to understand the basics of how the c++ build process works first - how does a text file become an executable file?

> This guide is for hxcpp, not c++. Only simplified essentials are covered.

In a simple view, there are two main stages to take a c++ file to an executable. The first step is to _compile_ the source code into an object file, and the second step is to _link_ all the object files together into an executable. In a simple form, it looks like this:

`g++ -Wall -c example.cpp -o example.o `

> `-Wall` - enable all warnings (a very good idea)    
> `-c` compile the file example.cpp   
> `-o` the output file should be called example.o   

If there were no errors, the c++ _compiler_ generates the object file, ready for linking. To link the object file into an executable, we give the object file(s) to the _linker_. In the case of the GCC compiler (the one in the above example) the linker is a part of the same tool and understands the object files given to it. This just means the linker is called via the same command - don't let that distract you.

`g++ example.o -o example`

> `example.o` - read this object file   
> `-o` link and _output_ the executable called `example`  

If there were no linker errors, you now have a valid executable file to run.

One last note, the example above was expanded to show you both steps in a c++ build and you don't always split them up this way. The compiler usually will automatically link the object files it creates and go directly to the executable (the `-c` option told it to just do the compile part). The example below does the linking automatically and creates the executable called `example` as well.

`g++ example.cpp -o example`

## The Haxe build process

Now that we're a bit more familiar with what happens on the lowest level - we can consider the higher level for a moment. How does a `.hx` file become an executable via hxcpp?

To get to that, we have to know what the Haxe compiler does and the role it plays in the build process. Consider the following Haxe example code "hello hxcpp":

```haxe
class Example {
    static function main() {
        trace('Hello, hxcpp!');
    }
}
```

To compile this to an executable, we run the Haxe compiler.

`haxe -main Example -cpp bin/`

> `-main` Example.hx is our class with `static function main`   
> `-cpp` Target hxcpp, and put the output inside the `bin/` folder

After you run this, you should see a `bin/` folder and inside it, an `Example` executable which you can now run. You'll also see a few other files - a `Build.xml`, an `include` and `src` directory, an `Options.txt` and finally an `obj` folder. We'll learn to understand these in detail later.

If you peek inside the `bin/obj/` folder, you'll find a bunch of `.o` files, we recognize these. And, if you look inside the `bin/src/` folder you'll find a bunch of the hxcpp runtime files (like `__main__.cpp`) and you'll also find `Example.cpp`.

It's not much of a leap now to fully understand what's happening from here. The Haxe compiler takes your `Example.hx` file, generates `src/Example.cpp` from it, hands it to a c++ compiler which generates an object file (like `obj/bc98a4ab_Example.o`) and then links them all together with the rest of the object files, and the c++ compiler creates the executable for us.

This is no different from the very basic c++ example above, the difference is that the hxcpp build toolchain is running the c++ compiler for us. In fact, it prints the commands while it's running, you can see the two stages clearly:

>note: the arguments and paths are stripped away for clarity

Compile:

`g++ -c -x c++ ./src/Example.cpp -o bin/obj/darwin64/bc98a4ab_Example.o`

Link:

`g++ -o Example @bin/obj/darwin64/all_objs`


A final note: by adding the define `-D no-compilation`, the output sources will be generated but the c++ compiler won't be called.

## The hxcpp build process

Now that we understand that the c++ compiler is responsible for generating our output executable on the lower level, and we understand that the Haxe compiler generates the c++ files to compile on the higher level, the last remaining piece is the one level between those two.

How does hxcpp know which c++ files to compile? How does it decide which compiler to use on different platforms or targets? How does it configure all the flags and options for the c++ compiler?

All of this and more is the purpose of this section of the guide, starting with the anatomy of a hxcpp build.
