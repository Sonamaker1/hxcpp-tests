# 5.0 Building a dynamic library from haxe/hxcpp code

The idea that you could tell the haxe compiler and hxcpp backend to create a dll/dylib/so file with the code it generates is a very alluring concept.

This concept however is not easily approached, as the issue lies in how c++ works, and the many reasons that c++ is not typically used in the outward facing API of a dynamic library. It is important to understand and reiterate that hxcpp is simply just c++ code in the end. It can't do what c++ can't do without the limitations of c++ being present. 

To make that a more concrete issue, it is worth stepping back and considering what the common issues are for exposing c++ functions and types in a dynamic library. Take note that there is a stark difference between c functions, and c++ functions. Specifically talking about c++ - it carries with it significant weight that makes using it in a dynamic library often impractical or impossible.

Also note that explicitly the term _outward facing API_ is used above. Having c++ code in a dynamic library is not much of an issue - but rather trying to use that code across the dynamic library boundaries, i.e by importing it as the API interface itself. Below we will cover some reasons as to why.

## Can c++ generally be exposed in a dynamic library?

The simplified and unambiguous answer is no.   

The reasons are many, and if your narrow requirements manage to fit past the numerous limitations of trying to do this you might find a way to do so. This is not the general use case.

Since the scope of how c++ and dynamic libraries work in detail is wide, and this guide is about using hxcpp more effectively, we will only cover the broadest of strokes as to the problems involved. There will be many simplifications below to get the point across. There are countless articles and documents on why c++ inside of a dynamic library is not typically the outward facing API, as this problem is not a new one to the language.

Note again, that these issues have everything to do with c++ itself, and not the hxcpp backend which uses c++ to function.

### Challenge 1: Name mangling

It's likely you would have heard of this issue when dealing with c++ exports in a dynamic library. When creating code in plain c, functions were _symbols_ and had a singular place - in other words - there was no _namespace_ and no _function overloads_ to make a symbol ambiguous. If you had a symbol called `my_function` that was the only symbol that would be allowed in your linked code with that name. This is one source of the ever so common duplicate symbol errors you will encounter in c/c++.

However, there is a way for a function symbol in plain c to be ambiguous, and that relates direclty to the [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions). If your function exists as a symbol such as `my_function` there is no real way to ascertain what calling convention was intended/required by the author of the code - so when using certain conventions, the name will need to be "decorated" to differentiate.

Here's an example from the Wikipedia page on [Name Mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling) of how that looks for three calling conventions. You don't need to understand all the underlying details of the conventions themselves but just understand the existence of name mangling in context of c and later c++.

```c++
int _cdecl    f (int x) { return 0; }
int _stdcall  g (int y) { return 0; }
int _fastcall h (int z) { return 0; }
```

The above code could be emitted:

```
_f
_g@4
@h@4
```

Notice how the `_f` is undecorated, and the others are decorated. This is name mangling, and it exists even in c.

#### Name mangling in c++

Since c++ added namespaces, function overloads and many other ways to differentiate the same symbol, it required a much more elaborate name mangling scheme in order for the exact symbol to be found later.

The scheme is defined by the c++ compiler itself, rather than by the language. This is a crucial issue to take note of, that name mangling is not well defined. Trying to compile a library and using that library elsewhere will require full knowledge of the mangling scheme and how to decode it. In simpler terms, it means that the exact same compiler must be used for the library as well as the _client_ in order to know it will decode correctly. This is a huge limitation of course, as you may want to build a library to be consumed by another language (like python or c#) and having to know at runtime what the library is compiled against for decoding the mangling is not all that practical, especially across multiple platforms and compilers. Still some people attempt this, YMMV.

Let's take a really simple example again from the name mangling page linked above, this time compiled by a c++ compiler (instead of c).

```c++
int  f (void) { return 1; }
int  f (int)  { return 0; }
int  g (void) { return 0; }
```

Note the symbols are the same name, but the endpoint is a different function.
The generated code from the c++ compiler may look something like this:

```c++
int  __f_v (void) { return 1; }
int  __f_i (int)  { return 0; }
int  __g_v (void) { return 0; }
```

It's also useful to know name mangling applies to all the symbols, so even if `g` appears unambiguous it will get decorated as well.

For more complicated types and functions, the decorations become quite elaborate. Without duplicating their whole page here, these are some examples of a function, inside of a class, inside of a namespace in simple c++.

`_ZN9wikipedia7article6formatEv`   
`_ZN9wikipedia7article8print_toERSo`   
`_ZN9wikipedia7article8wikilinkC1ERKSs`   

It should be clear that requiring every _client_ of your library to be able to decode any potential mangling scheme from any compiler across any plaform including all changes across versions over time, all calling conventions - is simply a nightmare of an idea. There are many more troubling aspects of exposing c++ directly as an API, though. 

### Challenge 2: Dependency

Exposing a c++ type in a dynamic library requires that all the information about that type is known, and compiled into the library as well. Say for instance, you have a class that inherits a parent class. This parent class must also be exposed in the library, or it won't work. This is true for all the data and members of your class: **any** type you use must also be exported (as long as it is not a primitive c++ type, like an `int`). This also holds true for the implicit generated code like move, copy or assignment operators and so on.

So let's say your code wanted to use std::string, you will have to expose all of the std::string implementation, every dependent of that, and every dependent of their dependencies as well - it is an avalanche to say the least. Any class and type that is used must be known and exposed, which as you can imagine is just as much of a nightmare as it sounds.

### Challenges 3-N: Everything else 

There are many other challenges that become apparent the further you go trying to expose c++ in a dll. We'll briefly cover a few. 

The c runtime linked to the library needs to be the same for the compiled types as it is in the client, if not the c runtime may have data around that is valid in the client but not in the library, as they are not talking about the same memory. This would lead to inconsistencies and nightmares, on windows alone the varieties of CRT (/MT, /MTd, /MD /MDd) have given many c++ programmers a rough time due to the requirements of the runtime being the same across a whole project and it's dependencies. Now try to be cross platform, or cross language.

The exception handling model of the client and the dynamic library must also match. This means the same compiler flags usually, as the exception handling may not be the same across different compilers and platforms.

Exporting types wholesale creates a very tight coupling between the client and the types. If you happened to change a function name in your library, literally every client would be unable to use the new version of the library any more without updating their code. This often defeats the intent of building code into a dynamic library, but can be viewed as treating the dynamic library as if it were a static library. It's a feasible approach in some cases.

Suffice to say that simply adding an "export" flag to c++ code generated by haxe and trying to use that library is going to be only useful in the most slim cases. The impracticality of using c++ as your outward facing API in practice is not typically approachable for the majority. 

### hxcpp dllexport / dllimport
All that said, hxcpp does have some `dllexport` and `dllimport` flags available which generate export attributes in the output code but be warned it is not often used. To avoid skimming readers misunderstanding the section, the information on exactly how to do that won't be placed here.


## So how does one use c++ code in a library?

The answer is by wrapping the c++ code in an outward facing API that is usable across different compilers, platforms, runtimes, exception handling models, no name mangling and so on. 

This is why `extern "C"` exists in the language.

There are other ways such as abstract interface like classes (the concept of COM in Windows is stemmed from this approach) but there are limitations there too, and the requirements of wrapping your hxcpp generated code are the same as extern c wrapping. 

For the widest use of your library in other languages, you ideally opt for `extern "C"` with a simple well defined, well versioned API using opaque handles or primitive types for the data going in and out of the library. There are still important considerations like memory ownership and lifetimes but those are again, not new to the concept of dynamic libraries and out of scope for this document.

In the next section, we will cover doing this in practice with an example!
