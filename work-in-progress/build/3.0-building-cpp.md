# Building cpp via the hxcpp build tool

Building an executable from cpp code by using the build XML format and the hxcpp build tool.

## Two stages of a cpp build

If you recall in the intro we covered that a cpp build is composed of a _compile_ step followed by a _linking_ step. The hxcpp build xml is constructed in the same way - it has nodes to configure both.

We're going to compile a very simple c++ program using hxcpp instead of calling the c++ compiler and linker directly.
To do this, we create a file called `example.cpp` and inside of it, we put this basic code.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, hxcpp!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

Save this file alongside a new build XML file. We will stick with the known convention of calling it `Build.xml` for now.

`/`
`- Build.xml`
`- example.cpp`

## compiling – <files>

Now we want tell hxcpp to compile our cpp file, but how?

The answer is to use the `<files>` node which contains a list of `<file>` nodes within it, which points to the files that hxcpp should compile for us. The file path is relative to the build XML file, if the path isn't an absolute path.

The `files` node requires an `id` attribute, which we'll use later.

```xml
<files id="sources">
    <file name="example.cpp" />
</files>
```

We can nearly compile this already, but we also have to tell hxcpp what it is we're trying to achieve with our input by defining an output - a target for the build.

## linking – <target>

We've seen a target node before, but this time we need to add some details so that it has something to do.
When we run a `Build.xml` with `haxelib run hxcpp` it will try to run the `default` target unless told to look for something else.

Since a target is defining an _output_, we have to also choose what _type_ of target it's going to be.

To do this, we have to specify three minimum attributes: `tool`, `toolid` and `output`.
The tool we are going to use for this target is the `linker` tool - since we want to link some files together. The `toolid` we are going to want for this specific build is `exe` - we're building an executable. There are other options for building a static or dynamic library instead of an executable. And finally the output will determine what the target generates.

And finally, in order to make our target whole, we have to tell the target which `<files>` nodes we want to include into the output. This is just a reference to our previous files node we created and gave an id, we use the id to point to our list of files. This allows the same files to be referenced by multiple targets.

This is how our target looks, and how our `Build.xml` looks now that it is ready to go:

```xml
<xml>
    <files id="sources">
        <file name="example.cpp" />
    </files>

    <target id="default" tool="linker" toolid="exe" output="example">
        <files id="sources"/>
    </target>
</xml>
```

## building

Since we have everything in place, we can now run `haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml` and you should see a newly created `obj` folder with the object files, and the `example` executable file which we asked hxcpp to link for us.

That's it for the basics of building cpp files, but we should also look at the `files` and `target` flag a bit closer because these are used to configure the c++ compiler itself.

## c++ build configuration

It's important to pay attention to the fact that the `files` node is associated with the **compile** step and the `target` is associated with the **link** step.

This will help you know where to place any configuration you might need to do for the c++ build - be it a linker flag or a linking against a library file - or specifying compiler preprocessor defines or flags for the c++ compiler to use.

**compiler flags**

We'll start with a simple c++ define, which goes in the `files` node as a `<compilerflag>` node. The defines are set in the same way with `-Ddefine` without a space.

>It's worth noticing here that the compiler flags are specific to the `files` node that they belong to. In other words, if you have c++ files that require a define but that define should not be defined for every other file, you would probably want to isolate it within it's own `files` node. Every `<file>` inside of the node will have these flags applied.

We'll define a silly example, following c++ convention of all capital letter defines, and we will shield it with a `serious` flag on the hxcpp build:

```xml
<files id="sources">
    <compilerflag value="-DBE_LESS_EXCITED" if="serious"/>
    <file name="example.cpp" />
</files>
```

And we can modify the example c++ code like this:

```c++
#if BE_LESS_EXCITED
    std::cout << "hxcpp, hello.\n";
#else
    std::cout << "Hello, hxcpp!\n";
#endif
```

If we build again, the output will be the same, unless we specify the `-Dserious` flag, then the output will change.

`haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Dserious`

**linker flags**
