# Linking options and build targets

When compiling c++ code via the hxcpp build tool, we can select a type of linking to perform, as well as a target toolchain to compile against.

The example code for this chapter is located at [examples/4.0-linking-and-targets]

## Linking statically or dynamically

> It's important to understand that the c++ code you compile via hxcpp is regular c++, and conforms to all the norms that c++ does in general, with regards to static and dynamic linking.

To compile our given code differently, we have to make a minor change to our xml file, specifically our target node. It has a `toolid='exe'` directive which is explicitly telling the hxcpp build tool we want to build an executable.

There are two other linker tools we'd like to use, so we have to do define a variable to switch based on our input flags. We put this at the top of the xml file so it's easy to find later (just after the `<xml>` node). Note the variable name `LINK_TOOLID` is up to you (I would prefer that there be a built in default for this!)

```xml
    <set name="LINK_TOOLID" value="exe"/>
    <set name="LINK_TOOLID" value="dll" if="dynamic_link"/>
    <set name="LINK_TOOLID" value="static_link" if="static_link"/>
```

Now, we default to executable, and switch to dll or static linking based on the flags. Now to use our variable in the `toolid` value:

```xml
<target id="default" tool="linker" toolid="${LINK_TOOLID}" output="example">
```

**Static linking**   
To build a static library file, all you need to do is to give hxcpp the `static_link` define. This define can also be set from the haxe level, which then the hxcpp build will receive from haxe, and it can also be set inside of a build XML file as a value, or on the command line.

If you ran `haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Dstatic_link` against the example code, you would obtain a different file named `example` - the exact name depends on the build target - on Mac and Linux for instance, the extension is `.a`. For windows it is `.lib`.

>Since no target is specified yet, it builds for your current platform.

**Dynamic linking**   
The alternative way to build c++ code is to compile it into a dynamic link library, also known as a shared object `.so` (unix), `.dll` (Windows)  `.dylib` (Mac), depending on the target. Some things choose a unique extension, but in the end all are the same thing.

To compile and link a dynamic library via the build tool, define `dynamic_link`. Like above, it can be specified as a haxe define, in the build XML or as an argument.

`haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Ddynamic_link`

When run against the example code, you should now also see an `example.dylib`, `example.dll` or `example.so` depending on the build target.

**Platform specifics**   
It's useful to keep in mind that some platforms require dynamic or static linking - such as android - you would only ever load a dynamic library from the Java side of an application in order to run native code, never an executable. On iOS (prior to newer frameworks) only static linking was an option.

## Specifying a build target toolchain

Since the hxcpp build tool has to speak to the c++ compiler, it has a set of definition files that describe exactly how to do that for a number of platforms and targets.

For instance, when you build on Windows, by default it will attempt to find and run MSVC, and on Mac it would build against `clang` and Linux `gcc`. 

These toolchains are self contained, and are stored in the `hxcpp/toolchain` folder in the hxcpp source code. Each toolchain defines a compiler, and possibly multiple `linker` nodes to handle the `toolid` we saw above. These toolchains, and how they work are described in detail in a future chapter. 

For now all we need to know is that we can specify a target, of which there are quite a few, and a toolchain will be selected for that target, and the build commands will be run via that toolchain workflow.

**Built in targets**

- `linux`
- `mac`
- `windows`
- `winrt` 
- `mingw`
- `cygwin`
- `android` 
- `iphoneos` / `iphonesim`
- `appletvos` / `appletvsim`
- `watchos` / `watchsimulator`
- `rpi`
- `emscripten`
- `webos`
- `tizen`
- `blackberry`
- `gph`
- `gcw0`

Note that some targets allow cross compilation and some don't, a more detailed list will be found in the target reference [link will go here].

To specify a target to compile for, you also specify it as a define. This again can be a haxe define, defined in the build XML, or defined on the command line.

`haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Dmac`

You can only specify one target, and targets often have accompanying defines. For instance, when building for android or iOS, you may want to specify an architecture to compile and link for: 

`haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Dandroid -DHXCPP_ARMV7`

If run against our example, this would generate an `libexample.so`. As you can see, the different platforms having overlapping extensions and names can become a problem, but hxcpp has a number of internal variables to deal with this, which we can insert into the build XML to specify a more descriptive filename. This may also be true for your use case with regards to the debug flag.

### Specifying a target specific filename

Our final change to the target node in our build XML is to specify a more descriptive name for the output, based on the target, flags, and based on your preferences:

```xml
<target id="default" tool="linker" toolid="${LINK_TOOLID}" output="${LIBPREFIX}example${DBG}${LIBEXTRA}">
```

The `LIBPREFIX` is commonly the `lib` prefix or similar, the `LIBEXTRA` usually contains the architecture specifics, the `DBG` value is assigned to `-debug` if the debug flag is given. There is also `LIBEXT`, although the target toolchain specifies the extension by default, or our target could have an `<ext>` node as well if needed.

This means if we ran:

`haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Dandroid -DHXCPP_ARMV7 -Ddebug -Ddynamic_link`

We would get:

`libexample-debug-v7.so` as the output name.

### Specifying a target bin directory

Another common requirement is a separate bin directory for the targets. There is a `BINDIR` variable available for this purpose, and uses a common naming scheme for the targets.

Let's add this to the `outdir` of our target node:

```xml
 <target id="default" tool="linker" toolid="${LINK_TOOLID}" output="${LIBPREFIX}example${DBG}${LIBEXTRA}">
        <outdir name="${BINDIR}"/>
        <files id="sources"/>
    </target>
```

Now when we build the same command, 

`haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Dandroid -DHXCPP_ARMV7 -Ddebug -Ddynamic_link`

We end up with:

`Android/libexample-debug-v7.so`

A common pattern for the `BINDIR` value is `Linux`, `Linux64`, `Mac`, `Mac64`, `Windows`, `Windows64` and so on. For targets with multiple architectures like iOS and Android, they are typically appended in `LIBEXTRA` so they land in `Android`, `iPhone` and not architecture specific ones.

It should be noted however that new variables can be defined to your liking, existing variables can also be redefined from your build XML, haxe code, or command line.

## Conclusion

This concludes the steps and understanding necessary to build c++ code via the hxcpp build tool, how to configure it via defines and variables, how to give it files to build, and finally how to link in various ways against various targets.
