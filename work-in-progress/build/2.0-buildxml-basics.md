# The hxcpp build XML format

Understanding the basic XML nodes and structure of the hxcpp build format is quite easy.

## Build XML basics

As with any XML, it typically starts with a root `<xml>` node and ends with a closing `</xml>` node. There is no requirement for any attributes on the root node in this case.

```xml
<xml>
</xml>
```

Nodes can and often use the shorthand type, for instance `<set />`. Nodes can use single or double quotes for attributes. `<set name="" value=''/>`

In order to run a build, you have to have a `target` node defined even if it is empty.

```xml
<xml>
    <echo value="hello, hxcpp"/>
    <target id="default"/>
</xml>
```

You can run this XML file now using `haxelib run hxcpp basic.xml`, and it should print the expected value to the output. As you can see the filename doesn't matter when passing it to the build tool directly.

**Some important nodes to know about**

```xml
<echo value="Print a value" />
```
>Prints to the build output for debugging and build information.

```xml
<error value="An error message" />
```
>This will stop the build process in its tracks.   
Useful for enforcing correct user configurations, debugging defines, variables and more.

```xml
<setenv name="ENV_VARIABLE" value="1"/>`  
```
>Sets a temporary system environment variable for the duration of the build.

```xml
<include name="another.xml"/>`  
<import name="relative.xml"/>`  
```
>Includes or imports (relative) another build xml file into the build at that point. This allows you to compose and encapsulate build specifics by file and include them as necessary into the build process modularly.

```xml
<copyFile name="some.file" from="some/path/"/>`  
```
>Copies `some/path/some.file` to the output directory. An optional attribute for `allowMissing` lets you specify whether it's ok for the file to not exist, otherwise an error will be generated.

For a full list, see the build xml reference guide.

## configuration via defines

From our previous section, we can see that defines are what configure and control the hxcpp build. Inside of our root node, we can define new values from within the build stage. This is what the `set` node does, and it's attributes are simply `name` and `value`. It is also possible to `unset` a define, removing it's value from the build.

`<set name="define" value="define_value"/>`
`<unset name="define"/>`

Consider the following example, leading on from our previous understanding:

```xml
<xml>
    <set name="HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE" value="App" />
</xml>
```

This would essentially hardcode the output file name to App, since it would be _after_ the build tool is invoked.

## conditional attributes

The hxcpp build nodes have two main attributes that you can use for conditional configuration. These two attributes are `if` and `unless`. The value of the attribute is _any_ define, meaning that any defined value can be used - `if="any-hxcpp-build-define"`

Let's continue our output file example, and this time we will set the name to `App` only if no existing name has been specified previously. Previous in this context means either _from the Haxe compiler defines_ or _from the hxcpp build tool command line defines_. When we are in the XML, we are now inside the build stage and past that point.

Have a look at this example:

```xml
<set name="HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE" value="App" unless="HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE"/>
```

We can read this out loud by saying "set HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE unless it has been set to something already". If it hasn't been set, it will be blank and this node will be activated.

For the sake of example, let's also add an additional condition that is under a different name. The conditions inside of `if` and `unless` **ONLY** allow the OR operator `||` to be used when adding multiple values.

```xml
<set name="HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE" value="App"
     unless="use_default_output_name || HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE" />
```

Now if we run Haxe with `-D use_default_output_name` or `haxelib run hxcpp` with `-Duse_default_output_name` it will also not be activated.

The `if` condition is just as simple to use.

```xml
<set name="HAXE_OUTPUT_FILE" value="App" if="use_app_for_output_name" />
```

## build local flags
Since the defines set at this point are within the build process, they can be treated as build specific flags, and often are used to combine logical comparisons and conditions for flexibility and control over the build itself.

For a simple flag, we just set the value to `1` ao it is no longer blank.

```xml
<set name="my-flag" value="1" />
```

This allows you to combine multiple flags under a single concise condition, like the following:

```xml
<set name="is_mobile" value="1" if="android || iphone"/>
<set name="is_desktop" value="1" if="mac || linux || windows"/>
```

Now we can use the `is_mobile` flag to control mobile specific build configuration or to exclude configuration from mobile:

```xml
<set name="HXCPP_OUTPUT_FILE" value="App" if="is_desktop" />
<set name="HXCPP_OUTPUT_FILE" value="MobileApp" if="is_mobile"/>
```

It is also valid to include one an `if` and an `unless`.

```xml
<set name="HXCPP_OUTPUT_FILE" value="App" if="is_desktop" unless="windows" />
```

## grouping via sections

Obviously if we have many related nodes, it would quickly become verbose, illegible and unmaintainable to explicitly add `if`/`unless` under each node.

The build XML offers a `section` node to solve this. These nodes also allow conditions, making it easy to separate build configuration into logical groupings. Nodes within the sections can then have further fine grained control.

```xml
<section if="android" unless="no_android_flags">
    <set name="android-flag-A" value="1" if="condition"/>
    <set name="android-flag-B" value="1"/>
    <set name="android-flag-C" value="1" unless="other-condition" />
</section>
```

## defines as variables

Haxe defines and hxcpp defines can carry a value with them, and we can use a syntax similar to the Haxe string interpolation to read values out of a define for use.

```xml
<set name="my-variable" value="hello, hxcpp" />
<echo value="${my-variable}"/>
```

If you modified the original `basic.xml` above it would print the same value.

## Built in defines

It's very important to understand that hxcpp sets up some default and quite important defines for you right out of the gate:

```xml
<echo value="${HXCPP}"/>
```

There is also a special define for querying the path of an installed haxelib via the following syntax `${haxelib:libname}`.
This makes the following equivalent to the above:

```xml
<echo value="${haxelib:hxcpp}"/>
```

And we can deduce how that HXCPP define is created:

```xml
<set name="HXCPP" value="${haxelib:hxcpp}"/>
```

When you build for a specific platform or target, there are likely going to be a number of defines created by the settings for that build. There are also potentially defines created by files that are brought into the build via `include` or `import` nodes.

This has the side effect of the build configuration seeming a little bit like a black box, because values that are used are unclear in origin.

It is important to consider however that the build system itself is really simple - and the values are only set in a very limited number of ways. We will get into where these values come from in detail later on, but you should already be able to search the XML files within the hxcpp code and find many `<set>` nodes in various locations.

As with any programming, good naming conventions go a long way. All of the hxcpp specific defines are typically all uppercase and start with `HXCPP_`. This helps differentiate and locate them easily within the build configuration files or build tool source code itself.

## Building something

Now that we have a clear understanding of the configuration process for a build, we can actually make one from scratch. We'll do that in the next section.
