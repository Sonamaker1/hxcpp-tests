# Introduction to the CFFI (C foreign function interface)

This section covers the CFFI that hxcpp implements. The CFFI allows you to pass values and call functions between Haxe and C code safely, allowing you to bind c++ code to endpoints that you can call directly from your Haxe code.

The code in the c++ side is compiled as a dynamic or static library, and implements an API that allows you to pass opaque values back and forth in order to treat value types simply.
